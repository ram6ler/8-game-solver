    <h1>8-Game Solver</h1>
    <p>This is a little demo that uses A* path-finding to solve
        <em>8-Game</em>. The sum of Manhattan distances between tiles and their
        correct destinations is used as a heuristic.
    </p>
    <p>Click on the tiles to slide them, on the <em>Shuffle!</em> button to
        perform a thousand random moves, or on the <em>Solve!</em> button to see
        the solution.</p>
